#### Steps for a proper issue. **(REMOVE THIS AFTERWARDS)**
[ ] **ONLY REPORT ISSUES FOUND IN THE LATEST BUILD**
[ ] Find our what you want to report (bug or feature, see more below)
[ ] Tell us the full name of your current build, your model + modem- & bootloader-version

#### I found a bug, what to do?
[ ] If possible, find and describe a way to reproduce to bug **(REMOVE THIS AFTERWARDS)**
[ ] Exactly describe what happened afterwards
[ ] Append **all possible** logcats, I really like logcats made with **SysLog**, those issues will probably be processes faster

#### I' missing an feature, what to do?
[ ] Describe the feature as you would like to have it
[ ] If you know the issue from another (Stock)-ROM, tell us here
[ ] **WHAT WE (PROBABLY) NEVER WILL/CAN ADD*: **VoLTE: We don't have the stuff required to make this possible**, **Samsung Pay: You killed it yourself by triggering KNOX**
